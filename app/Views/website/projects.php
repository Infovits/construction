                        We believe that society, and our rural areas in particular, can be lifted up out of dire poverty and attain middle class status if given the necessary push. Through consultancies and development projects, FADC channels relevant training, resources and opportunities to rural youth, women and men for them to climb out of disadvantaged conditions of lack of access to information and education, lack of input and output markets and lack of financing, among other bottlenecks.

                       <h4><u>3,000 SHFs Trained in FARMER BUSINESS SCHOOL (FBS) GIZ-MODEL</u></h4>

                        Through financing from GIZ, FADC trained over 3,000 SHFs in 7 districts (Dedza, Ntcheu, Balaka, Machinga, Zomba, Mulanje, Thyolo). In this program, farmers in the Soy bean, Groundnuts and Cassava value chains under-went a 5-day FBS course through qualified trainers that were allocated to their Farmer Organisations. Due to COVID-19, trainings took place outdoors and in observance of other preventive measures.

                        Farmers were taken through 12 Farmer Business School Modules that exposed them to concepts in having enough food throughout the year, nutrition planning, coming up with an agricultural calendar, a financial calendar, Money-In Money-Out, Marketing, How to obtain good financial services, benefits of being a member of an FO and contract farming, among other areas.
